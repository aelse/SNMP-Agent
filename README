SNMP-Agent

This module aids in the building of SNMP subagents. It is a very simple
way to extend the functionality of the system SNMP daemon via its AgentX
support.

For any SNMP information to be provided by the agent a SNMP OID is
coupled with a function that generates the desired output.  A trivial
example of this is included in the perldoc information.

Depends on: 

	NetSNMP::agent
	NetSNMP::ASN
